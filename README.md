This is a collections of notes of useful codes and tips that I will use to build my github, I will try to add to this everytime I learnt something new, it will start as a list and when I start to learn lots of things I will try to create a table of lists and add in codes to make this more presentable.

TeX Mathematical Formulae
A full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here's a good reference, and you can try stuff out on CodeCogs. You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.

Here are some examples to try out:

$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$
$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$

2. Add emoji to repository description :smiley: 
  - Emoji by type https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/
  - Emoji by alphabet https://readme.io/emojis/
